<p>The IoT-ready features like pre-installed sensor packages integrated with Bosch Rexroth&rsquo;s connectivity stack turns the electrohydraulic system into a Connected Product. Cytroconnect therefore offers sensor data visualization and condition monitoring via a web-based dashboard accessible everywhere.

<p>We only use such cookies and tracking mechanisms if you have given us your prior consent in each case. We distinguish between two sub-categories with regard to these cookies and tracking mechanisms:</p>
<p><strong>Convenience cookies</strong></p>
<p>These cookies facilitate operation and thus allow you to browse our online service more comfortably; e.g. your language settings may be included in these cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing cookies and tracking mechanisms</strong></p>

<p>By using marketing cookies and tracking mechanisms, our partners and we are able to show you offerings based on your interests, resulting from an analysis of your user behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistics:</li>
</ul>
<p>By using statistical tools, we measure e.g. the number of your page views.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion tracking:</li>
</ul>
<p>Our conversion tracking partners place a cookie on your computer (&ldquo;conversion cookie&rdquo;) if you accessed our website via an advertisement of the respective partner.</p>
<p>Normally these cookies are no longer valid after 30 days. If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, the relevant conversion partner and we can recognize that a certain user clicked on the advertisement and thereby was redirected to our website. The information obtained by means of the conversion cookie serves the purpose of compiling conversion statistics and recording the total number of users who clicked on the respective advertisement and were redirected to a website with a conversion tracking tag.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social plugins:</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the pages of our online service involve content and services of other providers (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) which also may use cookies and active modules. For more details regarding social plugins please refer to the section on social plugins</p>
<ul>
<li>Retargeting:</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools create user profiles by means of advertising cookies or third-party advertising cookies so called &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo; (invisible graphics that are also called pixels or tracking pixels), or by means of comparable technologies. These are used for interest-based advertising and to control the frequency with which the user looks at certain advertisements. The relevant provider is the controller responsible for the processing of data in connection with the tool. The providers of the tools might disclose information also to third parties for the purposes mentioned above. Please note the data protection notices of the relevant provider in this context.</p>
<p>Please note that using the tools might include transfer of your data to recipients outside of the EEA where there is no adequate level of data protection pursuant to the GDPR (e.g. the USA). For more details in this respect please refer to the following description of the individual marketing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Google Analytics</p>

<p>In our privacy settings, you may withdraw the consent with effect for the future or grant your consent at a later point in time.</p>
<p><strong>Social Plugins</strong></p>
<p>In our Online Offers we use so-called social plugins from various social networks. They are individually described in this section.</p>
<p>When using plugins, your internet browser creates a direct connection to the respective social networks’ server. Hereby the respective provider receives the information that your internet browser accessed from the respective site of our Online Offers - even if you do not have a user account with this provider or are currently not logged into your account. Log files (including the IP address) are, in this case, directly transmitted from your internet browser to a server of the respective provider and might be stored there. The provider or its server may be located outside the EU or the EEA (e.g. in the United States).</p>
<p>The plugins are standalone extensions by social network providers. For this reason, we are unable to influence the scope of data collected and stored by them.</p>
<p>Purpose and scope of the collection, the continued processing and usage of data by the social network as well as your respective rights and setting options to protect your privacy can be found by consulting the respective social network&rsquo;s data protection notices.</p>
<p>In case you do not wish social network providers to receive and, if applicable, store or use data, you should not use the respective plugins.</p>

<p>LinkedIn is provided by LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Twitter”).

In doing so, data is transferred to YouTube as a data controller. We are not responsible for the processing of such data by YouTube.</p>
<p>Additional information on the scope and purpose of collected data, on further processing and usage of data by YouTube, on your rights and the privacy options available to be chosen by you, can be found in YouTube&rsquo;s data protection notice.</p>

Upon clicking on the link, we have no influence on the collecting, processing and use of personal data possibly transmitted by clicking on the link to the third party (such as the IP address or the URL of the site on which the link is located) as the conduct of third parties is naturally beyond our control. We do not assume responsibility for the processing of personal data by third parties.</p>
