  CytroConnect is Bosch Rexroth's approach to provide real-time monitoring and analytics (i.e. predictive maintenance) capabilities to
  electrohydraulic systems.  


  The IoT-ready features like pre-installed sensor packages integrated with Bosch Rexroth's connectivity stack turns the electrohydraulic system into a Connected Product.
  Cytroconnect therefore offers sensor data visualization and condition monitoring via a web-based dashboard accessible everywhere. 
  Modular paid add-ons offered as risk-free monthly subscriptions address further smart maintenance and prediction use cases.
