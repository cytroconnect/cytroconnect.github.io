  **Convenience cookies**


  These cookies facilitate operation and thus allow you to browse our online service more comfortably; e.g. your language settings may be included in these cookies.

  
  **Marketing cookies and tracking mechanisms**


  General


  By using marketing cookies and tracking mechanisms, our partners and we are able to show you offerings based on your interests, resulting from an analysis of your user behavior:


  - Statistics:


  By using statistical tools, we measure e.g. the number of your page views.


  - Conversion tracking:


  Our conversion tracking partners place a cookie on your computer ("conversion cookie") if you accessed our website via an advertisement of the respective partner.


  Normally these cookies are no longer valid after 30 days. If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, the relevant conversion partner and we can recognize that a certain user clicked on the advertisement and thereby was redirected to our website. The information obtained by means of the conversion cookie serves the purpose of compiling conversion statistics and recording the total number of users who clicked on the respective advertisement and were redirected to a website with a conversion tracking tag.


  - Social plugins:


  Some of the pages of our online service involve content and services of other providers (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) which also may use cookies and active modules. For more details regarding social plugins please refer to the section on social plugins


  - Retargeting:


  These tools create user profiles by means of advertising cookies or third-party advertising cookies so called "web beacons" (invisible graphics that are also called pixels or tracking pixels), or by means of comparable technologies. These are used for interest-based advertising and to control the frequency with which the user looks at certain advertisements. The relevant provider is the controller responsible for the processing of data in connection with the tool. The providers of the tools might disclose information also to third parties for the purposes mentioned above. Please note the data protection notices of the relevant provider in this context.


  Please note that using the tools might include transfer of your data to recipients outside of the EEA where there is no adequate level of data protection pursuant to the GDPR (e.g. the USA). For more details in this respect please refer to the following description of the individual marketing tools.


  **Name:** Google Analytics


  **Provider:** Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA


  Function: Analyses user behaviour (page views, number of visitors and visits, downloads), UX testing


  **Management of cookies and tracking mechanisms**


  You can manage your cookie and tracking mechanism settings in the browser and/or our privacy settings.


  Note: The settings you have made refer only to the browser used in each case.


  **Deactivation of all cookies**


  If you wish to deactivate all cookies, please deactivate cookies in your browser settings. Please note that this may affect the functionality of the website.


  **Management of your settings with regard to cookies and tracking mechanisms not required technically**


  When visiting our websites, you will be asked in a cookie layer whether you consent to our using of any marketing cookies or tracking mechanisms, respectively.


  In our privacy settings, you may withdraw the consent with effect for the future or grant your consent at a later point in time.


  **Social Plugins**


  In our Online Offers we use so-called social plugins from various social networks. They are individually described in this section.


  When using plugins, your internet browser creates a direct connection to the respective social networks’ server. Hereby the respective provider receives the information that your internet browser accessed from the respective site of our Online Offers - even if you do not have a user account with this provider or are currently not logged into your account. Log files (including the IP address) are, in this case, directly transmitted from your internet browser to a server of the respective provider and might be stored there. The provider or its server may be located outside the EU or the EEA (e.g. in the United States).


  The plugins are standalone extensions by social network providers. For this reason, we are unable to influence the scope of data collected and stored by them.


  Purpose and scope of the collection, the continued processing and usage of data by the social network as well as your respective rights and setting options to protect your privacy can be found by consulting the respective social network's data protection notices.


  In case you do not wish social network providers to receive and, if applicable, store or use data, you should not use the respective plugins.


  **Social plugins from LinkedIn**


  LinkedIn is provided by LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Twitter”). You will find an overview of the plugins from LinkedIn and their appearance here: https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins; you will find information on data protection at LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.


  **YouTube**


  Our Online Offers use the YouTube video platform which is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave. San Bruno, CA 94066, USA („YouTube”). YouTube is a platform which allows the playback of audio and video files.


  When you access a respective site of our Online Offers that contains an embedded YouTube player, this creates a connection to YouTube so that the video or audio file can be transmitted and played back. In doing so, data is transferred to YouTube as a data controller. We are not responsible for the processing of such data by YouTube.


  Additional information on the scope and purpose of collected data, on further processing and usage of data by YouTube, on your rights and the privacy options available to be chosen by you, can be found in YouTube's data protection notice.


  **External links**


  Our Online Offers may contain links to third party internet pages – by providers who are not related to us. Upon clicking on the link, we have no influence on the collecting, processing and use of personal data possibly transmitted by clicking on the link to the third party (such as the IP address or the URL of the site on which the link is located) as the conduct of third parties is naturally beyond our control. We do not assume responsibility for the processing of personal data by third parties.


  **Security**


  Our employees and the companies providing services on our behalf, are obliged to confidentiality and to compliance with the applicable data protection laws.
